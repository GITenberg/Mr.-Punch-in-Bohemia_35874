<h2>THE WAY TO BOHEMIA</h2>

<p>Time was when Bohemianism
was synonymous
with soiled linen and unkempt
locks. But those
days of the ragged
Bohemia have happily
passed away, and that
land of unconventional life&mdash;which
had finally grown
conventional in its characteristics&mdash;has
now become
"a sphere of influence" of
Modern Society! In a
word, it is now respectable. There are those who firmly
believe it has been wiped off the social map. The dress suit
and the proprieties are thought by some to be incompatible
with its existence. But it is not so; the new Bohemia is
surely no less delightful than the old. The way to it is
through the doors of almost any of the well-known literary
and art clubs of London. Its inhabitants are our artists,
our men of letters, our musicians, and, above all, our actors.</p>

<p>In the present volume we are under the guidance of
Mr. Punch, himself the very flower of London's Bohemia,
into this land of light-hearted laughter and the free-and-easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
manner of living. We shall follow him chiefly through
the haunts of the knights of the pen and pencil, as we
have another engagement to spend some agreeable hours
with him in the theatrical and musical world. It should be
noted, however, that we shall not be limited to what has
been called "Upper Bohemia", but that we shall, thanks to
his vast experience, be able to peep both at the old and new.</p>

<p>Easily first amongst the artists who have depicted the
humours of Bohemia is Phil May. Keene and Du Maurier
run him close, but their Bohemia is on the whole more
artistic, less breezily, raggedly, hungrily unconventional than
his. It is a subject that has inspired him with some of his
best jokes, and some of his finest drawings.</p>

<h2>PUNCH'S PROVERBS</h2>

<p>Most sticks have two ends, and a muff gets hold
of the wrong one.</p>

<p>The good boy studies his lesson; the bad boy
gets it.</p>

<p>If sixpence were sunshine, it would never be lost
in the giving.</p>

<p>The man that is happy in all things will rejoice
in potatoes.</p>

<p>Three removes are better than a dessert.</p>

<p>Dinner deferred maketh the hungry man mad.</p>

<p>Bacon without liver is food for the mind.</p>

<p>Forty winks or five million is one sleep.</p>

<p>You don't go to the Mansion House for
skilligolee.</p>

<p>Three may keep counsel if they retain a barrister.</p>

<p>What is done cannot be underdone.</p>

<p>You can't make a pair of shoes out of a pig's tail.</p>

<p>Dinner hour is worth every other, except bedtime.</p>

<p>No hairdresser puts grease into a wise man's
head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>An upright judge for a downright rogue.</p>

<p>Happiness is the hindmost horse in the Derby.</p>

<p>Look before you sit.</p>

<p>Bear and forebear is Bruin and tripe.</p>

<p>Believe twice as much as you hear of a lady's age.</p>

<p>Content is the conjuror that turns mock-turtle
into real.</p>

<p>There is no one who perseveres in well-doing
like a thorough humbug.</p>

<p>The loosest fish that drinks is tight.</p>

<p>Education won't polish boots.</p>

<p>Experience is the mother of gumption.</p>

<p>Half-a-crown is better than no bribe.</p>

<p>Utopia hath no law.</p>

<p>There is no cruelty in whipping cream.</p>

<p>Care will kill a cat; carelessness a Christian.</p>

<p>He who lights his candle at both ends, spills
grease.</p>

<p>Keep your jokes to yourself, and repeat other
people's.</p>

<h2>EDITORS</h2>

<blockquote><p>["Editors, behind their officialism, are human just like
other folks, for they think and they work, they laugh and they
play, they marry&mdash;just as others do. The best of them are
brimful of human nature, sympathetic and kindly, and full of
the zest of life and its merry ways."&mdash;<i>Round About</i>.]</p></blockquote>

<p>To look at, the ordinary editor is so like a
human being that it takes an expert to tell the
difference.</p>

<p>When quite young they make excellent pets,
but for some strange reason people never confess
that they have editors in the house.</p>

<p>Marriage is not uncommon among editors, and
monogamy is the rule rather than the exception.</p>

<p>The chief hobby of an editor is the collection of
stamped addressed envelopes, which are sent to him
in large numbers. No one knows why he should
want so many of these, but we believe he is under
the impression that by collecting a million of them
he will be able to get a child into some hospital.</p>

<p>Of course in these enlightened days it is illegal
to shoot editors, while to destroy their young is
tantamount to murder.</p>

<h2>A LETTER TO A YOUNG PUBLISHER</h2>

<p>Since, my dear Jones, you are good enough to
ask for my advice, need I say that your success in
business will depend chiefly upon judicious advertisement?
You are bringing out, I understand, a
thrilling story of domestic life, entitled "Maria's
Marriage." Already, I am glad to learn, you have
caused a paragraph to appear in the literary
journals contradicting "the widespread report that
Mr. Kipling and the German Emperor have
collaborated in the production of this novel, the
appearance of which is awaited with such extraordinary
interest." And you have induced a
number of papers to give prominence to the fact
that Mr. Penwiper dines daily off curry and clotted
cream. So far, so good. Your next step will be
to send out review-copies, together with ready-made
laudatory criticisms; in order, as you will explain,
to save the hard worked reviewers trouble. But,
you will say, supposing this ingenious device to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fail? Supposing "Maria's Marriage" to be universally
"slated"? Well, even then you need not
despair. With a little practice, you will learn the
art of manufacturing an attractive advertisement
column from the most unpromising material. Let
me give you a brief example of the method:&mdash;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">I.&mdash;The Raw Material.</span></h3>

<p>"Mr. Penwiper's latest production, 'Maria's
Marriage,' scarcely calls for serious notice. It
seems hard to believe that even the most tolerant
reader will contrive to study with attention a work
of which every page contains glaring errors of
taste. Humour, smartness, and interest are all
conspicuously wanting."&mdash;<i>The Thunderer.</i></p>

<p>"This book is undeniably third-rate&mdash;dull,
badly-written, incoherent; in fine, a dismal
failure."&mdash;<i>The Wigwam.</i></p>

<p>"If 'Maria's Marriage' has any real merit, it is
as an object-lesson to aspiring authors. Here, we
would say to them, is a striking example of the
way in which romance should not be written. Set
yourself to produce a work exactly its opposite in
every particular, and the chances are that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
will produce, if not a masterpiece, at least, a tale
free from the most glaring faults. For the terrible
warning thus afforded by his volume to budding
writers, Mr. Penwiper deserves to be heartily
thanked."&mdash;<i>Daily Telephone.</i></p>

<p>"'Maria's Marriage' is another book that we
have received in the course of the month."&mdash;<i>The
Parachute.</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II.&mdash;The Result.</span></h3>

<p>"Maria's Marriage!" "Maria's Marriage!"</p>

<p>Gigantic Success&mdash;The Talk of London.</p>

<p>The 29th edition will be issued this week if the
sale of twenty-eight previous ones makes this
necessary. Each edition is strictly limited!</p>

<p>"Maria's Marriage!"</p>

<p>The voice of the Press is simply <i>unanimous</i>.
Read the following extracts&mdash;taken almost at
random from the reviews of leading papers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Penwiper's latest production ... calls for
serious notice ... the reader will ... study with
attention a work of which every page contains
taste, humour, smartness and interest!"&mdash;<i>The
Thunderer.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Undeniably ... fine!"&mdash;<i>The Wigwam.</i></p>

<p>"Has ... real merit ... an object lesson ...
a striking example of the way in which romance
... should be written. A masterpiece ... free
from faults. Mr. Penwiper deserves to be heartily
thanked."&mdash;<i>Daily Telephone.</i></p>

<p>"The book ... of the month!"&mdash;<i>The Parachute</i>,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Maria's Marriage!" A veritable triumph!
Order it from your bookseller to-day!</p>

<p>That, my dear Jones, is how the trick is done.
I hope to give you some further hints on a future
occasion.</p>

<p>A well-known diner-out has, we learn,
collected his reminiscences, and would be glad to
hear from some obliging gentleman or gentlemen
who would "earnestly request" him to publish
them.</p>

<p>We should add that no names would be mentioned,
the preface merely opening as follows:&mdash;-</p>

<blockquote><p>"Although these stray gleanings of past years are of but
ephemeral value, and though they were collected with no
thought of publication, the writer at the earnest request of a
friend" (or "many friends," if more than one) "has reluctantly
consented to give his scattered reminiscences to the
world."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The following volumes in "The Biter Bit" series
are announced as shortly to appear:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Fighter Fit; or practical hints on pugilistic
training."</p>

In truth, wealth rarely improves the vision.

that they have opened an Establishment
for the Supply of Literature in
all its Branches.</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>Every Editor should send for our Prices and compare
them with those of other houses.</i></p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Poetry Department.</span></h3>

<p>We employ experienced poets for the supply of
garden verses, war songs, &amp;c., and undertake to fill
any order within twenty-four hours of its reaching
us. Our Mr. Rhymeesi will be glad to wait upon
parties requiring verse of any description, and, if
the matter is at all urgent, to execute the order on
the spot.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Drama Department.</span></h3>

<p>Actor-managers before going elsewhere should
give us a call. Our plays draw wherever they are
presented, even if it is only bricks.</p>

<p><i>Testimonial.</i>&mdash;A manager writes: "The play you
kindly supplied, <i>The Blue Bloodhound of Bletchley</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
is universally admitted to be <i>unlike anything ever
before produced on the stage</i>."</p>

<p>Musical comedies (guaranteed absolutely free
from plot) supplied on shortest notice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fiction Department.</span></h3>

<p>For society dialogues we use the very best
duchesses; while a first-class earl's daughter is
retained for Court and gala opera.</p>

<p>For our new line of <i>vie intime</i> we employ none
but valets and confidential maids, who have to
serve an apprenticeship with P.A.P.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Kailyard Department</span></h3>

<p>is always up-to-date, and our Mr. Stickit will be
pleased to call on any editor on receipt of post-card.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;We guarantee our Scotch Idyll to be
absolutely unintelligible to any English reader,
and undertake to refund money if it can be proved
that such is not the case.</p>

<p>Our speciality, however, is our <i>Six-Shilling
Shocker</i>, as sold for serial purposes. Editors with
papers that won't "go" should ask for one of these.
When ordering please state general idea required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
under one of our recognised sections, as foreign
office, police, mounted infantry, cowardice, Rome,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Biography.</span></h3>

<p>Any gentleman wishing to have a biography of
himself produced in anticipation of his decease
should communicate with us.</p>

<p>The work would, of course, be published with a
note to the effect that the writing had been a
labour of love; that moreover the subject with his
usual modesty had been averse from the idea of a
biography.</p>

<p><i>Testimonial.</i>&mdash;Sir Sunny Jameson writes: "The
Life gives great satisfaction. No reference made,
however, to my munificent gift of £50 to the
Referees' Hospital. This should be remedied in
the next edition. The work, however, has been
excellently done. You have made me out to be
better than even I ever thought myself."</p>

<h2>ARTIST'S VADE MECUM</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> Has the anxious parent been to see
his child's portrait?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> He has seen it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did he approve of it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He will like it better when I have made some
slight alterations.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are they?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He would like the attitude of the figure
altered, the position of the arms changed, the face
turned the other way, the hair and eyes made a
different colour, and the expression of the mouth
improved.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did he make any other suggestions?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; he wishes to have the child's favourite
pony and Newfoundland dog put in, with an indication
of the ancestral home in the back-ground.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is he willing to pay anything extra for these
additions?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He does not consider it necessary.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Are you well on with your Academy picture?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; but I began the charcoal sketch yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you secured the handsome model?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; the handsome model has been permanently
engaged by the eminent R.A.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Under these circumstances, do you still
expect to get finished in time?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; I have been at this stage in February

<h2>THE SUB-EDITOR'S AUNT</h2>

<p>"I always buy your paper my dear Horace," said
the old lady, "although there is much in it I cannot
approve of. But there is one thing that puzzles me
extremely."</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt?" said the Sub-Editor meekly, as
he sipped his tea.</p>

<p>"Why, I notice that the contents bill invariably
has one word calculated to stimulate the morbid
curiosity of the reader. An adjective."</p>

<p>"Circulation depends upon adjectives," said the
Sub-Editor.</p>

<p>"I don't think I object to them," the old lady
replied; "but what I want you to tell me is how
you choose them. How do you decide whether an
occurrence is 'remarkable' or 'extraordinary,'
'astounding' or 'exciting,' 'thrilling' or 'alarming,'
'sensational' or merely 'strange,' 'startling' or
'unique'? What tells you which word to use?"</p>

<p>"Well, aunt, we have a system to indicate the
adjective to a nicety; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Horace, I will never breathe a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
You should know that. No one holds the secrets
of the press more sacred than I."</p>

<p>The Sub-Editor settled himself more comfortably
in his chair.</p>

<p>"You see, aunt, the great thing in an evening
paper is human interest. What we want to get is
news to hit the man-in-the-street. Everything that
we do is done for the man-in-the-street. And
therefore we keep safely locked up in a little room
a tame man of this description. He may not be
much to look at, but his sympathies are right,
unerringly right. He sits there from nine till six,
and has things to eat now and then. We call him
the Thrillometer."</p>

<p>"How wonderful! How proud you should be
Horace, to be a part of this mighty mechanism,
the press."</p>

<p>"I am, aunt. Well, the duties of the Thrillometer
are very simple. Directly a piece of news
comes in, it is the place of one of the Sub-Editors to
hurry to the Thrillometer's room and read it to
him. I have to do this."</p>

<p>"Poor boy. You are sadly overworked, I fear."</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt. And while I read I watch his face,
Long study has told me exactly what degree of
interest is excited within him by the announcement.
I know instantly whether his expression
means 'phenomenal' or only 'remarkable,' whether
'distressing' or only 'sad,' whether&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is there so much difference between 'distressing'
and 'sad,' Horace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, aunt. A suicide in Half Moon Street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
is 'distressing'; in the City Road it is only 'sad.'
Again, a raid on a club in Whitechapel is of no
account; but a raid on a West-End club is worth
three lines of large type in the bill, above Fry's
innings."</p>

<p>"Do you mean a club in Soho when you say
West-End?"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt, as a rule."</p>

<p>"But why do you call that the West-End?"</p>

<p>"That was the Thrillometer's doing, aunt. He
fell asleep over a club raid, and a very good one
too, when I said it was in Soho; but when I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
him of the next&mdash;also in Soho, chiefly Italian
waiters&mdash;and said it was in the West-End, his eyes
nearly came out of his head. So you see how
useful the Thrillometer can be."</p>

<p>"Most ingenious, Horace. Was this your idea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt."</p>

<p>"Clever boy. And have the other papers
adopted it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt. All of them."</p>

<p>"Then you are growing rich, Horace?"</p>

<p>"No, no, aunt, not at all. Unfortunately I lack
the business instinct. Other people grow rich on
my ideas. In fact, so far from being rich, I was
going to venture to ask you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me more about the Thrillometer," said the
old lady briskly.</p>

<h2>HOW TO BE AN AUTHOR</h2>

<p>Mr. Punch, having read the latest book on the
way to write for the press, feels that there is at
least one important subject not properly explained
therein: to wit, the covering letter. He therefore
proceeds to supplement this and similar books....
It is, however, when your story is written
that the difficulties begin. Having selected a
suitable editor, you send him your contribution
accompanied by a covering letter. The writing of
this letter is the most important part of the whole
business. One story, after all, is very much like
another (in your case, probably, exactly like
another), but you can at least in your covering
letter show that you are a person of originality.</p>

<p>Your letter must be one of three kinds: pleading,
peremptory, or corruptive. I proceed to give
examples of each.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Pleading Letter.</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
199, <i>Berkeley Square, W.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;I have a wife and seven
starving children; can you possibly help us by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
accepting this little story of only 18,000 (eighteen
thousand) words? Not only would you be
doing a work of charity to one who has suffered
much, but you would also, I venture to say, be
conferring a real benefit upon English literature&mdash;as
I have already received the thanks of no fewer
than thirty-three editors for having allowed them
to peruse this manuscript.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours humbly,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">The McHardy</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;My youngest boy, aged three, pointed
to his little sister's Gazeka toy last night and cried
"De editor!" These are literally the first words
that have passed his lips for three days. Can you
stand by and see the children starve?</p></blockquote>

<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Peremptory Letter.</span></h3>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Kindly publish at once and oblige</p>

<p class="regards">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Eugene Hackenkick</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I shall be round at your office to-morrow
about an advertisement for some 600 lb. bar-bells,
and will look you up.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Corruptive Letter.</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="author"><i>Middlesex House, Park Lane, IV.</i><br /></p>

<p class="salute"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Smith</span>,&mdash;Can you come and dine
with us quite in a <i>friendly</i> way on Thursday at
eight? I want to introduce you to the Princess of
Holdwig-Schlosstein and Mr. Alfred Austin, who
are so eager to meet you. Do you know I am
really a little <i>frightened</i> at the thought of meeting
such a famous editor? Isn't it <i>silly</i> of me?</p>

<p class="regards">Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Emma Middlesex</span>.
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I wonder if you could find room in your
<i>splendid little paper</i> for a silly story I am sending
you. It would be such a surprise for the Duke's
birthday (on Monday).&mdash;E. M.</p></blockquote>

<p>Before concluding the question of the covering
letter I must mention the sad case of my friend
Halibut. Halibut had a series of lithographed
letters of all kinds, one of which he would enclose
with every story he sent out. On a certain occasion
he wrote a problem story of the most advanced
kind; what, in fact, the reviewers call a "strong"
story. In sending this to the editor of a famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
magazine his secretary carelessly slipped in the
wrong letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Editor</span>," it ran, "I am trying to
rite you a littel story, I do hope you will like my
little storey, I want to tell you about my kanary
and my pussy cat, it's name is <i>Peggy</i> and it has
seven kitens, have you any kitens, I will give you
one if you print my story,</p>

<p class="regards">"Your loving little friend,</p>

<h2>AN ARTISTIC EPISODE</h2>

<blockquote><p>["Incapacity for work has come to be accepted as the
hall-mark of genius.... The collector wants only the thing
that is rare, and therefore the artist must make his work as
rare as he can."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Josephine found me stretched full length in a
hammock in the garden.</p>

<p>"Why aren't you at work?" she asked; "not
feeling seedy, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Never better," said I. "But I've been making
myself too cheap."</p>

<p>"We couldn't possibly help going to the Joneses
last night, dear."</p>

<p>"Tush," said I. "I mean there is too much of
me."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand," she said; "but there
certainly will be if you spend your mornings lolling
in that hammock."</p>

<p>The distortive wantonness of this remark left me
cold.</p>

<p>"I have made up my mind," I continued, quite
seriously, "to do no more work for a considerable
time."</p>

<p>"But, my dear boy, just think&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to make myself scarce," I insisted.</p>

<p>"Geoffrey!" she exclaimed, "I knew you weren't
well!"</p>

<p>I released myself.</p>

<p>"Josephine," I said solemnly, "those estimable
persons who collect my pictures will think nothing
of them if they become too common."</p>

<p>"How do you know there are such persons?"
she queried.</p>

<p>"I must decline to answer that question," I
replied; "but if there are none it is because my
work is not yet sufficiently rare and precious. I
propose to work no more&mdash;say, for six or seven
years. By that time my reputation will be made,
and there will be the fiercest competition for the
smallest canvas I condescend to sign."</p>

<p>She kissed me.</p>

<p>"I came out for the housekeeping-money," she
remarked simply.</p>

<p>I went into the house to fetch the required sum,
and, by some means I cannot explain, got to work
again upon the latest potboiler.</p>

<h2>CONSOLATIONS FOR THE UNHUNG</h2>

<p>Now that the painful month of suspense in
Studioland is at an end, it behoves us to apply our
most soothing embrocation to the wounded feelings
of geniuses whose works have boomeranged their
way back from Burlington House. Let them
remember:</p>

<p>That very few people really look at the pictures
in the Academy&mdash;they only go to meet their
friends, or to say they have been there.</p>

<p>That those who <i>do</i> examine the works of art are
wont to disparage the same by way of showing
their superior smartness.</p>

<p>That one picture has no chance of recognition
with fourteen hundred others shouting at it.</p>

<p>That all the best pavement-artists now give
"one-man" shows. They can thus select their
own "pitch," and are never ruthlessly skied.</p>

<p>That photography in colours is coming, and
then the R.A. will have to go.</p>

<p>That Rembrandt, Holbein, Rubens and Vandyck
were never hung at the summer exhibition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>That Botticelli, Correggio and Titian managed
to rub along without that privilege.</p>

<p>That the ten-guinea frame that was bought (or
owed for) this spring will do splendidly next year
for another masterpiece.</p>

<p>That the painter <i>must</i> have specimens of his
best work to decorate the somewhat bare walls of
his studio.</p>

<p>That the best test of a picture is being able to
live with it&mdash;or live it down&mdash;so why send it away
from its most lenient critic?</p>

<p>That probably the <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> sent in was
shown to the hanging committee up-side down.</p>

<p>That, supposing they saw it properly, they were
afraid that its success would put the Academy to
the expense of having a railing placed in front.</p>

<p>And finally, we would remind the rejected one
that, after all, his bantling <i>has</i> been exhibited in
the R.A.&mdash;to the president and his colleagues
engaged in the work of selection. Somebody at
least looked at it for quite three seconds.</p>

<h2>THE YOUNG NOVELIST'S GUIDE TO MEDICINE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloroform.</span> Invaluable to writers of sensational
stories. Every high-class fictionary criminal
carries a bottle in his pocket. A few drops, spread
on a handkerchief and waved within a yard of the
hero's nose, will produce a state of complete
unconsciousness lasting for several hours, within
which time his pockets may be searched at leisure.
This property of chloroform, familiar to every
expert novelist, seems to have escaped the notice
of the medical profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Consumption.</span> The regulation illness for use
in tales of mawkish pathos. Very popular some
years ago, when the heroine made farewell speeches
in blank verse, and died to slow music. Fortunately,
however, the public has lost its fondness for work
of this sort. Consumption at its last stage is easily
curable (in novels) by the reappearance of a hero
supposed to be dead. Two pages later the heroine
will gain strength in a way which her doctors&mdash;not
unnaturally&mdash;will describe as "perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
marvellous." And in the
next chapter the marriage-bells
will ring.</p>

types: (<i>a</i>) The eminent
specialist. Tall, imperturbable,
urbane. Only comes
incidentally into the story. (<i>b</i>) Young, bustling,
energetic. Not much practice, and plenty of time
to look after other people's affairs. Hard-headed
and practical. Often the hero's college friend.
Should be given a pretty girl to marry in the last
chapter. (<i>c</i>) The old family doctor. Benevolent,
genial, wise. Wears gold-rimmed spectacles,
which he has to take off and wipe at the pathetic
parts of the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fever.</span> A nice, useful term for fictionary
illnesses. It is best to avoid mention of specific
symptoms, beyond that of "a burning brow,"
though, if there are any family secrets which need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
to be revealed, delirium is sure to supervene at a
later stage. <i>Arthur Pendennis</i>, for instance, had
fictional "fever," and baffled doctors have
endeavoured ever since to find out what really
was the matter with him. "Brain-fever," again,
is unknown to the
medical faculty, but
you may safely afflict
your intellectual hero
with it. The treatment
of fictionary
fever is quite simple,
consisting solely of
frequent doses of
grapes and cooling
drinks. These will
be brought to the
sufferer by the
heroine, and these simple remedies administered in
this way have never been known to fail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture.</span> After one of your characters has
come a cropper in the hunting-field he will be
taken on a hurdle to the nearest house: usually, by
a strange coincidence, the heroine's home. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
he will be said to have
sustained "a compound
fracture"&mdash;a
vague description
which will quite
satisfy your readers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gout.</span> An invaluable
disease to the
humorist. Remember
that heroes and
heroines are entirely
immune from it, but
every rich old uncle
is bound to suffer from it. The engagement of his
niece to an impecunious young gentleman invariably
coincides with a sharp attack of gout. The
humour of it all is, perhaps, a little difficult to see,
but it never fails to tickle the public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heart Disease.</span> An excellent complaint for
killing off a villain. If you wish to pave the way
for it artistically, this is the recognised method:
On page 100 he will falter in the middle of a
sentence, grow pale, and press his hand sharply to
his side. In a moment he will have recovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and will assure his anxious friends that it is
nothing. But the reader knows better. He has
met the same premonitory symptoms in scores of
novels, and he will not be in the least surprised
when, on the middle of page 250, the villain
suddenly drops dead.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
